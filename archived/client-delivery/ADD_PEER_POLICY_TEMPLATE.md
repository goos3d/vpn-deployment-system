# VPN Peer Addition Policy & Support

## Adding More Devices/Users (Peers)

Your VPN system is fully functional and includes one configured device. If you wish to add more devices/users ("peers"), you have two options:

### 1. **Self-Service (Free, within 30-day support)**
- We provide step-by-step guidance for adding peers yourself.
- Includes a free consultation call to explain the process and answer questions.
- Written instructions and best practices provided.
- If you run into issues, we will assist (remotely) at no charge within your 30-day warranty/support window.

### 2. **Done-For-You Service (Billable)**
- We handle all technical steps: generate new peer config, update server, deliver files.
- **Fee:** $75 per additional peer (minimum 2 peers per request) OR $150/hr (minimum 2 peers per request).
- Includes remote support for installation and troubleshooting.
- Fast turnaround (same day or next business day).

## How to Request
- Email or text with the device name and user (e.g., "Add iPhone for Dr. Kover").
- We'll schedule a quick call or send instructions/files as needed.

## Why This Policy?
- Keeps your system secure and organized
- Ensures HIPAA compliance for every new device
- Lets you control costs: DIY or full-service

## 30-Day Warranty/Support
- All initial setup and one peer are covered
- Free guidance for self-service peer addition
- Billable for additional peers or after 30 days
