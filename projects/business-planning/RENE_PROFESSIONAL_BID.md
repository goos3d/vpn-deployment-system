## ðŸŽ¯ WINNING BID STRATEGY

### **Response Script:**
```
Hi Rene,

Thanks for reaching out! I specialize in professional VPN and network security solutions, and I'd be happy to help optimize your travel router setup for secure remote work.

Rather than just a basic router configuration, I provide a comprehensive approach that includes:

â€¢ Advanced VPN optimization for travel networks
â€¢ Security hardening for public WiFi protection  
â€¢ Performance tuning for reliable remote work
â€¢ Professional documentation and setup guide
â€¢ 30-day email support for any questions

I work on a project basis rather than hourly to ensure you get a complete, professional solution. For a travel router VPN optimization like this, my fee is $400, which includes everything above plus a follow-up consultation to ensure everything is working perfectly for your travel needs.

I recently completed a comprehensive VPN security project for Dr. Kover's medical practice, implementing enterprise-grade monitoring, HIPAA compliance, and disaster recovery systems. I also received a 5-star review from Kenny C. who highlighted my "expertise, experience and knowledge" - I bring that same professional approach to every project.

Would you like to schedule a brief call to discuss your specific travel and remote work requirements?

Best regards,
Thomas

P.S. I can typically complete this type of setup within 24-48 hours of project approval.

## ðŸŽ¯ BACKUP PRICING OPTIONS

### **If $400 Seems High to Client:**

```

### **If Client Wants Hourly:**
```
"I typically work project-based for better value, but I can accommodate hourly at $125/hr with a 3-hour minimum to ensure proper setup and testing. Most clients find the project approach more cost-effective since it includes documentation and follow-up."
