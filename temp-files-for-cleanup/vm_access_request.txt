Subject: Server Access Request - Final Cleanup

Hi Dr. Kover,

I hope you're enjoying the new VPN system! Everything is working perfectly on your end.

I need to perform one final security step to complete the project. I need to log into the ServerOptima server one more time to remove my development files and GitHub access credentials for security best practices.

Could you please provide the administrator login credentials for the Windows VPS at 184.105.7.112? I just need to:
- Remove my personal GitHub authentication 
- Clean up any temporary development files
- Ensure the system is completely secure for your practice

This will only take 5-10 minutes and ensures your server meets the highest security standards.

Thank you for your business - it was a pleasure working with your practice!

Best regards,
