                     PRIVATE - POST-HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

üîí CONFIDENTIAL - FOR YOUR EYES ONLY - NOT FOR CLIENT

After sending Dr. Kover the handoff email, you need to clean up the VM to 
remove all your personal traces while keeping his VPN running.

================================================================================
EXECUTION ORDER:
================================================================================

1. ‚úÖ SEND EMAIL TO DR. KOVER FIRST
   - Use files in DR_KOVER_FINAL_HANDOFF/ folder
   - Wait for his acknowledgment that VPN is working

2. üßπ THEN CLEAN THE VM  
   - Follow VM_CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.txt step by step
   - SSH into 184.105.7.112
   - Remove all personal traces
   - Preserve VPN functionality for Dr. Kover

3. üéØ COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL HANDOFF
   - VM is clean and professional  
   - Dr. Kover has working VPN + documentation
   - You're positioned for future paid services

================================================================================
WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:
================================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  Clean VM AFTER email confirmation because:
   - Dr. Kover needs to test his current setup first
   - If there are issues, you need your access to fix them
   - Once cleaned, remote troubleshooting becomes harder
   - Professional handoff means client confirms everything works

================================================================================
REVENUE POSITIONING ACHIEVED:
================================================================================

‚úÖ Dr. Kover has complex manual instructions (10-15 min per device)
‚úÖ Your automation scripts are NOT included (behind paywall)  
‚úÖ Professional service pricing clearly listed ($50-200)
‚úÖ He'll likely pay for convenience after trying manual process

================================================================================

Execute VM cleanup only AFTER successful email handoff confirmation! üéØ
