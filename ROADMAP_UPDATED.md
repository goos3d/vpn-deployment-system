#### 2.2 Healthcare Market Focus
- [ ] **Template:** HIPAA compliance documentation
- [ ] **Create:** Healthcare-specific configuration templates
- [ ] **Develop:** Audit trail and logging for healthcare compliance

#### 2.3 Service Packaging
- [ ] **Define:** $500, $1500, $5000 service tier CLI packages
- [ ] **Create:** Automated deployment scripts for each tier
- [ ] **Document:** Service delivery playbooks

### **PHASE 3: FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS (3+ months)**
**Priority:** LOW - If demand requires

#### 3.1 Web GUI Revival (Optional)
- [ ] **Assess:** Market demand for web interface
- [ ] **Redesign:** Simplified, reliable web dashboard
- [ ] **Implement:** Only if justified by client requirements

#### 3.2 Advanced Features
- [ ] **API:** REST API for integration with client systems
- [ ] **Monitoring:** Client connection status and usage analytics
- [ ] **Automation:** Zero-touch client provisioning
