# Privacy Sanitization - Client Information Scrubbed

## Overview
All client-specific information has been replaced with generic placeholders to protect privacy while maintaining the functional examples and documentation structure.

## Placeholder System
- **[CLIENT_NAME]** - Generic client name placeholder
- **[CLIENT_EMAIL]** - Generic email placeholder  
- **[CLIENT_DOMAIN]** - Generic domain placeholder
- **[client-name]** - Lowercase version for filenames/branches
- **[CLIENT_PRACTICE]** - Generic business name placeholder

## Original Client Case Study
The original deployment was for a dental practice VPN system with HIPAA compliance requirements. This successful case study demonstrated:
- Remote access for healthcare practice
- HIPAA-compliant security implementation  
- Professional client delivery package
- $375 basic VPN deployment success

## Files Containing Sanitized References
- `PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md` - All client references replaced with placeholders
- Active documentation files updated with generic examples
- Archived client delivery files preserved as historical records (in `/archived/` folder)

## Important Note
The `/archived/client-delivery/` folder contains the actual client delivery files from the original project. These are preserved as historical records and proof of successful deployment, but should be kept private and not shared publicly.

## Business Impact Preserved
The technical methodology, system architecture, and business model remain fully documented while protecting client privacy. This allows the system to be shared, demonstrated, and replicated without exposing sensitive client information.
